# EmployeeAttrition
The purpose of this short project is to explore employee data from IBM and develop a machine learning model to predict employee attrition. Using Decision Tree Classifier, the data show top 5 features that best predict whether an employee will likely to quit the company; the accuracy score was 82%. However, since this is a basic exploratory project, further analysis is needed for better accuracy and application.
